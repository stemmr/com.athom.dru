## DRU
You can use this app to control your DRU fireplace.
Currently the supported DRU-haard features are:

- Main flame on/off
- Secondary flame on/off
- flame height (0-100%)
- lights on/off
- Reading temperature

Before using the app however there are a few guidelines that will allow for a better user experience.

> <b>Do not turn the flames on or off too often within a couple of seconds.</b>
>
Although it should be handled correctly if you abuse your fireplace, it is generally a good idea to handle your it with care. The fireplace will detect this strange behavior and disallow ignition for a couple of seconds. Also, due to regulations the height of the flame may only be changed once every 10 seconds. It is intended that the state of the fireplace is not changed more often than once every ~30 seconds.

### Faults

Faults occur if the device cannot process the commands being sent. They may occur when using the remote control in tight conjunction with this app or sometimes when an excessive amount of commands are being sent simultaneously or from multiple sources. Due to regulations faults must be handled manually. If you happen to encounter a Fault your remote will display a code starting with F followed by the fault number (e.g. F08 ), the best way to resolve it is to press the up and down buttons (∧∨) together on your DRU remote control. This will reset the fireplace which allows you to control it again.
